# Audio reference

All SFX are CC0 (Kenney.nl, public domain). Music and SFX should be used by default unless the user passes `--no-music`, `--no-sfx`, the required assets are missing, or the plan explicitly chooses silence as the strongest creative move.

Bias toward a smooth, professional result: one tasteful music bed plus a small number of well-timed SFX usually feels better than silence.

## Audio-reactive visuals

When music is present, prefer a subtle audio-reactive treatment unless the tone asks for stillness or deadpan restraint. This does not mean beat detection. It means Hyperframes can pre-extract per-frame audio data and use RMS/frequency-band energy to modulate existing visual elements.

Good uses:
- Hero glow or sky warmth breathes slightly with RMS
- Product card, phone, or metric panel gains subtle presence on bass
- Title, quote, or logo gets a soft treble glow on stronger musical moments
- Background depth, vignette, or light layer gently swells with the bed

Avoid:
- Waveform displays, equalizer bars, musical notes, or generic visualizer graphics
- Strobing, heavy pulsing, or text scaling that hurts readability
- Treating audio-reactivity as a substitute for good scene timing
- Claiming exact beat/BPM sync unless a real beat detector is available

Suggested plan notation:
```
Audio-reactive treatment: subtle; use music RMS/bass to make the hero glow and product card presence breathe. No waveform/equalizer visuals.
```

Hyperframes implementation note: follow the audio-reactive guidance owned by the `hyperframes-creative` skill (let that skill locate its own files), to extract per-frame audio data and sample it synchronously inside the composition timeline. The extraction helper ships with that skill — `/brag` does not provide it, so don't hardcode a path to it.

## Asset paths

All paths below are relative to `<skill-dir>`, this skill's own directory (see "Skill directory" in `SKILL.md`). It differs by install method, so resolve it rather than assuming `~/.claude/skills/brag/`.

SFX live under `<skill-dir>/assets/sfx/{casino,impact,interface,ui}/`, and the individual keypress set under `<skill-dir>/assets/sfx/keyboard/`.

Music lives at `<skill-dir>/assets/music/`.

Bundled music cue presets live beside the music:

```text
<skill-dir>/assets/music/cues/<track-stem>.music-cues.md
<skill-dir>/assets/music/cues/<track-stem>.music-cues.json
```

SFX analysis lives beside the SFX library:

```text
<skill-dir>/assets/sfx/sfx-analysis.md
<skill-dir>/assets/sfx/sfx-analysis.json
```

**Critical: copy audio files into the composition project before rendering.** Hyperframes validates and serves assets from the composition directory. Always copy the files you need into `<output-dir>/composition/assets/` first:

```bash
# Create local asset dirs
mkdir -p <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/interface <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/impact <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/casino <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/ui
mkdir -p <output-dir>/composition/assets/music

# Copy only the files you plan to use (not the entire library)
cp <skill-dir>/assets/sfx/interface/bong_001.ogg <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/interface/
cp <skill-dir>/assets/sfx/impact/impactBell_heavy_000.ogg <output-dir>/composition/assets/sfx/impact/
cp <skill-dir>/assets/music/happy-beats-business-moves-vol-1-by-ende-dot-app.mp3 <output-dir>/composition/assets/music/
```

Then in the composition HTML, paths are **relative to the `composition/` directory**:
```
assets/sfx/interface/bong_001.ogg
assets/sfx/impact/impactBell_heavy_000.ogg
assets/music/happy-beats-business-moves-vol-1-by-ende-dot-app.mp3
```

Never use absolute paths (starting with `/Users/...`) — they will silently fail in the renderer.

## SFX library — approved files

The family SFX (casino, impact, interface, ui) live directly under `sfx/`; the individual keypress set lives in `sfx/keyboard/`.

Read `sfx-analysis.md` before choosing files — it lists safer picks by use case and flags files with high-frequency risk. Prefer low/medium HF risk for polished and repeated moments; reserve high-risk files for tiny isolated accents or chaotic tones.

### `keyboard/` — Individual keypress sounds

32 CC0 single keypress WAV files (`keypress-001.wav` through `keypress-032.wav`). Each is a distinct key sound at a slightly different velocity and character. Use these for per-character typing animations — randomize across the set so repeated characters don't sound robotic.

**Source:** [Keyboard Soundpack #1](https://opengameart.org/content/keyboard-soundpack-1-typing-and-single-keystrokes) by unicae_games — CC0

### `interface/` — UI sounds

| Files | Character | Use for |

| `impactGlass_heavy_002.ogg` | Glass shatter | Chaotic hit |
| `impactMining_001.ogg` | Mining strike | Industrial, heavy |

### `casino/` — Card and chip sounds

Specific but great for swipe/deal/stack moments.

| Files | Character | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `card-slide-1–8.ogg` | Card sliding | Swipe action, content sliding in |

| `rollover1–2.ogg`, `rollover4–5.ogg` | Hover/rollover | Subtle hover feedback, very soft accent |
| `switch1–38.ogg` (most variants) | Switch variants | Toggle, mode change — pick by character |

---

## Tone → SFX energy

| Tone | Energy | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | Moderate | 3-5 SFX at key moments. `interface/click` or `interface/drop_*` for pop-ins, `impactBell_heavy_000` for success, `impactSoft_medium` for reveals. |
| `polished` | Minimal but present | 2-3 very subtle SFX. `interface/bong_001` for a soft accent. `interface/drop_001` for a gentle reveal. Nothing aggressive. |
| `yc-parody` | Sparse but present | 2-3 restrained cues. One dry reveal hit (`impactSoft_medium`), one UI/card accent, one logo payoff if it fits. |
| `chaotic` | Dense | SFX on every beat, sometimes stacked. Mix `impact/impactPunch_heavy`, `interface/glitch_002`, `casino/dice-throw`, `impact/impactMetal_heavy`. |
| `deadpan` | Very sparse | Prefer one quiet music bed plus 1-2 dry cues. Full silence only when the plan explicitly says silence is the joke. |
| `cinematic` | 2-3 big ones | `impactBell_heavy_000` or `_004` for the hero moment. `impactSoft_medium` for the reveal. `impactBell_heavy_003` for the outro. |
| `app-store` | Consistent light layer | `interface/drop_*` or `interface/click_*` per feature card. `impactBell_heavy_000` on outro. All at 0.65-0.75 volume. |

## Moment → sound heuristics

Use these as examples for Hyperframes, not a fixed recipe. Sound should reinforce the edit, not call attention to itself.

| Moment type | Good sound families | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sequential cards/items opening | `casino/card-slide-*`, `casino/card-place-*`, `casino/card-fan-*`, `interface/drop_*` | Match the gesture. A card stack uses card sounds; a soft product grid can use drop sounds. For dense sequences, accent the first, last, or rhythmically important items only. |
| Big reveal / payoff | `impact/impactBell_heavy_000`, `_003`, or `_004`, `impact/impactSoft_medium_*`, `interface/bong_001` | One short announcement-style cue when the reveal lands. Keep it brief. |
| Text popping / typed copy | `keyboard/keypress-*.wav` (randomized), `interface/drop_*` | For per-character typing animations, pick a random file from `keyboard/` for each character. For soft label pop-ins, use `drop_001` or `drop_002`. Thin out or skip when copy is dense. |
| Simulated user action | `interface/click_*`, `interface/select_008`, `interface/switch_*`, `ui/mouseclick1`, `ui/switch*` | Use interaction sounds when the video shows a cursor, tap, button, toggle, swipe, or selection. Match the visible action. |
| Success / completion | `impact/impactBell_heavy_000`, `_003`, or `_004`, `casino/chips-collide-*` | Positive accent for approvals, matches, metrics, completed flows, or final CTAs. |
| Chaotic or comedic beat | `interface/glitch_002`, `interface/glitch_004`, `interface/error_005–006`, `impact/impactPunch_heavy_*`, `casino/dice-throw-*` | Reserve louder or weirder cues for tones that can handle them. |

When in doubt, pick fewer cues with better timing. Prefer a coherent sonic palette for the whole video over a grab bag of cute sounds.

## Timing rules

These rules apply when Hyperframes is implementing the composition and the motion timings are known:

- Align SFX to the **start** of the animation, not the end
- Entry pop: 0.0–0.1s before the element's first visible frame
- Transition: at the transition start time
- Success ding: at the moment the metric/stat is fully visible
- For staggered elements: usually accent the first, final, or strongest beat; only score every item when that rhythm is intentional and still feels clean

Composition notation:
```
Scene 2 — Reveal — 3s
  "Horse Tinder" scales in at 0.3s  →  SFX: impact/impactSoft_medium_001 at 0.2s
  Tagline fades up at 0.8s          →  (no SFX, let the reveal carry)
  Transition at 3.0s                →  SFX: interface/drop_001 at 2.9s
```

## Music

### Available tracks

All tracks are "Happy Beats / Business Moves" by ende.app. Upbeat, clean, corporate-adjacent. Good across multiple tones.

| Filename | Duration | Character | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `happy-beats-business-moves-vol-1-by-ende-dot-app.mp3` | 2:44 | Full upbeat track, most energetic | `default`, `app-store` |
| `happy-beats-business-moves-vol-9-by-ende-dot-app.mp3` | 1:54 | Mid-energy, slightly more laid-back | `default`, `yc-parody` |
| `happy-beats-business-moves-vol-10-by-ende-dot-app.mp3` | 1:00 | Compact loop, punchy | `default`, `chaotic` |
| `happy-beats-business-moves-vol-11-by-ende-dot-app.mp3` | 1:28 | Warm and business-y | `yc-parody`, `app-store` |
| `happy-beats-business-moves-vol-12-by-ende-dot-app.mp3` | 1:58 | Steady and clean | `polished`, `cinematic` |

For `deadpan` tone: prefer vol-12 at very low volume (0.12-0.18). Skip music only if the plan explicitly chooses silence.

### In a composition

After copying files (see Asset paths above), reference them with relative paths from `composition/`:

```html
<audio id="bg-music" data-start="0" data-duration="[total]" data-track-index="10" data-volume="0.35" src="assets/music/happy-beats-business-moves-vol-1-by-ende-dot-app.mp3"></audio>
```

Volume: 0.3-0.4 for normal music beds. Use 0.12-0.22 for deadpan or very restrained parody. Never above 0.5. SFX at 0.55-0.85, with softer values for polished/deadpan.

If the music file doesn't exist, skip it and notify the user after rendering.

### Beat and cue sources

Beat sync needs a cue source. Three are available — use the richest one the environment supports. Beat sync now works on **any** track, not just bundled ones. The two any-track methods (2 and 3) have orthogonal requirements — option 2 needs Python, option 3 needs a recent Hyperframes — so when one is unavailable the other usually covers it.

1. **Bundled track → precomputed preset (richest, instant, no deps).** The bundled tracks ship with cue metadata. Read the matching markdown summary, and pass the JSON path in `composition-brief.md`:

```text
<skill-dir>/assets/music/cues/<track-stem>.music-cues.md
<skill-dir>/assets/music/cues/<track-stem>.music-cues.json
```

2. **Any track → extended analysis (richest for custom tracks; needs Python, any Hyperframes version).** For a custom track — or to refresh a bundled one — run `analyze_music_cues.py` on the audio file. It produces the same rich cue JSON/Markdown for any track. Run it via `uv`, which auto-provisions the deps (`librosa`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `soundfile`) from `<skill-dir>/scripts/pyproject.toml` — no manual `pip install` needed:

```bash
uv run --project <skill-dir>/scripts \
  python <skill-dir>/scripts/analyze_music_cues.py <track>.mp3 \
  --output-json <output-dir>/composition/assets/music/cues/<stem>.music-cues.json \
  --output-md  <output-dir>/composition/assets/music/cues/<stem>.music-cues.md
```

This is the fallback when `hyperframes beats` (option 3) is unavailable — e.g. an older pinned Hyperframes. If neither `uv` nor the Python deps are available, use option 3 instead.

3. **Any track → `hyperframes beats` (simple, no Python; needs Hyperframes ≥ 0.6.99).** After the music is wired into the composition, run:

```bash
npx hyperframes beats <output-dir>/composition
```

It writes a per-track beat file: a beat grid with per-beat timing and a normalized `strength` (0-1), but no separate `strongCues` array — so derive "strong" beats by taking the highest-`strength` ones. (See the current hyperframes-cli `beats` guidance for the exact output path.) `beats` was added in Hyperframes 0.6.99; on an older pinned install it won't exist — fall back to option 2 (the script), or to the `unavailable` note below.

The preset and `analyze_music_cues.py` share the rich schema:

- `duration`, `tempo`
- `beats`: beat-grid points with `time` and normalized `intensity`
- `strongCues`: highest-value landing moments with `time`, `intensity`, and `kind` (`strong_beat` / `onset_peak`)
- `scoring`: feature and normalization metadata

`hyperframes beats` is the simpler floor: a plain beat grid with a per-beat strength, no strong-cue array.

Planning rules (apply to whichever source you have):

- Use cue metadata to bias timing, not control it.
- Major reveals may move toward strong cues within about `±0.15s`.
- Smaller entrances may align to nearby beat points within about `±0.10s`.
- Use 1-3 strong cue locks per 15-25s video.
- Ignore cues when they harm copy readability, scene pacing, or the product story.
- For deadpan or restraint-heavy tones, cues should be rare, quiet, or saved for the final logo.

Cue/beat metadata is not a substitute for Hyperframes audio-reactive visuals: it helps with beat/swell timing; audio-reactive data helps subtle visual properties breathe with the music.

If no source is available (no preset, no Python deps, and `hyperframes beats` not run), write:

```text
Music cue guidance: unavailable; continue without beat/cue sync.
```

### Adding SFX elements

Put the music bed on a low track and give each overlapping SFX its own ascending track-index (e.g. music at 10, SFX from 11 up). Never share a track-index between overlapping audio.

```html
<audio id="sfx-1" data-start="0.2" data-duration="1" data-track-index="11" data-volume="0.80" src="assets/sfx/interface/drop_001.ogg"></audio>
```

Wire each `<audio>` clip per the current hyperframes Data Attributes + Video/Audio contract (`data-track-index`, `data-volume`, `data-start`, `data-duration`). `/brag` owns only the volume policy above and the track-allocation convention; Hyperframes owns the clip schema.
