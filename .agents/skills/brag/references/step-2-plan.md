# Step 2: Write the brag plan

Write `<output-dir>/brag-plan.md`. One focused page. This is the creative north star for the entire video.

The plan should specify what the video must communicate and what project material must be used. It should not prescribe low-level Hyperframes implementation details. Hyperframes will decide the concrete composition structure, animation mechanics, and render workflow from the brief in Step 3.

## Create the output directory

```bash
mkdir -p <output-dir>
```

## Structure of brag-plan.md

```markdown
# Brag Plan: [App Name]

## What is this app?
[One sentence. What it does, what makes it funny or impressive.]

## The angle
[The creative premise. The joke, the hook, the claim.
What makes this video specific to this project and not generic.]

## Hook (first 2-3 seconds)
[The opening moment. This is the most important decision.
What word, image, or motion earns the next 20 seconds?]

## Key moments (the middle)
[2-3 sharp highlights from the product.
Bullet points. Specific. "The altitude meter counting up." 
Not "feature callouts."]

## Outro / punchline
[How does it land? The final line. The beat before the logo.]

## User flow worth showing
[The 2–3 beats of *using* the product (entry → key action → result), pulled from
Step 1 question 9. This is the strongest material the video has — the centerpiece
scenes should show the flow, not just landing-page sections. If the project is
landing-page-only, write "none — landing-page only" and rely on Key moments instead.]

## Tone
- Preset: [default / polished / yc-parody / chaotic / deadpan / cinematic / app-store]
- Creative direction: [freeform phrase, inferred or user-provided]
- Interpretation: [one sentence on how this affects pacing, writing, visual energy, and restraint]

## Format: [landscape / vertical / square] — [width]x[height]
## Duration: [target seconds]

## Visual identity (from the project)
- Background: [exact color value]
- Accent: [exact color value]
- Text: [exact color value]
- Display font: [name]
- Body font: [name]
- Strongest visual element: [what from the site to reference]

## Share copy (draft)
[One sentence for Twitter/X/LinkedIn/Discord. Punchy. Not corporate.]

## Audio direction
- Role: [warm bed / sparse professional accents / cinematic support / dense rhythmic layer / intentional silence]
- Music: [candidate track / mood / none only if disabled, missing, or intentionally silent]
- Music treatment: [start time, volume posture, fade-in/out intent, beat/swell notes]
- Music cue guidance: [preset cue file read / unavailable; list 1-3 strongCue timestamps for major moments; list beat-grid windows for sequential events]
- Audio-reactive treatment: [none / subtle / expressive; what visual qualities may respond to music energy]
- SFX posture: [sparse / moderate / dense; motion-matched; professional restraint]
- Audio-coupled moments: [visual ideas that should consider sound, e.g. typed text, beat reveal, count-up, card sequence]
- Restraint rule: [what audio must not do]

## Storyboard

### Scene 1 — [name] — [duration]s
[What's on screen. What text appears. What product material must be referenced.]
Sequential/interaction: [yes — describe what appears one by one or what interaction is simulated, e.g. "3 stat cards arrive one by one" or "cursor clicks the match button"; or none]
Audio intent: [what the sound should do emotionally]
Audio-coupled idea: [typed text, beat-aligned reveal, counter ticks, card-by-card sequence, simulated tap/swipe/type — or none]
Music: [mood, or "none" only if disabled / missing / intentionally silent]
Transition mood: [clean / hard / dramatic / soft / chaotic] → Scene 2

### Scene 2 — [name] — [duration]s
[...]
Sequential/interaction: [yes — describe it; or none]
Audio intent: [what the sound should do emotionally]
Audio-coupled idea: [type or none]
Transition mood: [mood] → Scene 3

[... continue for all scenes]

**Music mood for this video:** [upbeat / cinematic / chaotic / deadpan / parody / none only if disabled / missing / intentionally silent]
**Audio summary:** [one sentence describing the full audio arc]
```

## Planning the scenes

The default pattern is:
```
Hook → Reveal → 2-3 highlights → Punchline/outro
```

But adapt it. These are the right scene counts for each tone:

| Tone | Scenes | Pacing |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | 4-5 | Comfortable. Room for each moment to breathe. |
| `polished` | 3-4 | Fewer scenes, longer holds. Confidence through restraint. |
| `yc-parody` | 4-5 | Structured. The joke is how seriously it's delivered. |
| `chaotic` | 6-8 | Rapid. Some scenes under 2 seconds. |
| `deadpan` | 3-4 | Long holds. Big empty space. One word at a time. |
| `cinematic` | 4-5 | Wide shots. Big type. Dramatic reveals. |
| `app-store` | 4-6 | Feature cards. Clean reveals. No mess. |

## Duration guidance

Scene durations must sum to 15-25 seconds. Count them.

- Under 15 seconds: too thin, add a scene or lengthen holds.
- Over 25 seconds: cut a scene or tighten timing.
- 18-22 seconds is the sweet spot for most brag videos.

## Reading time (keep the pace, not at text's expense)

High pace comes from fast motion, fast transitions, and tight cuts — NOT from pulling text off screen before it can be read. Every text element a viewer must read needs enough fully-visible, settled time (entered, not yet exiting) to actually read it:

- Short label or 1-3 word line: about 0.8s settled.
- Headline or full sentence: about 0.3s per word, minimum ~1.2s. The hook line gets the most.

Plan that floor, then keep everything else fast: entrances and transitions stay snappy (0.3-0.6s) and motion stays energetic. A line can SLAM in fast and then HOLD — fast-in plus an adequate hold reads as punchy AND legible.

Two failure modes to design out at the plan stage:

- **Too much text for the scene length.** A 4s scene lands maybe 2-3 short reads at the floor, not 6. If a scene carries more text than its duration allows, cut copy or split the scene — do not speed it up.
- **Sequential text snapped onto a fast beat.** Beat-grid reveals can land ~0.5s apart at 110+ BPM (this is what rushed the bicycles spec rows). That spacing is fine for accents (glows, dots, ticks) but too fast for readable lines. For sequential TEXT, hold each item to the floor: snap to every other beat, or reveal them quickly and hold the full set on screen afterward. Flag any sequential text reveal in the storyboard with its intended hold.

## Choosing what to show

Every brag video must show something real from the product. Options, in preferred order:

1. **Recreate a working-app moment** — the upload screen, the result view, the dashboard with real-looking content. Use real source from `app/`, `pages/`, or routed components — not just the landing page. This is the most compelling option whenever the product has a flow. The product *doing* its thing beats the product *describing* its thing.
2. **Recreate a UI element in HTML** — a hero card, swipe UI, progress meter, stat block. Strong when there is no flow to show.
3. **Animate the core concept** — if the product is "taxis for taxis", animate two taxis where one is in the other. Pure graphic but grounded in the idea.
4. **Text-forward sequence** — if the product is copy-driven (Psychologists for Chatbots), let the copy be the visual. Giant display type, minimal chrome.

Never fill scenes with abstract patterns, color washes, or generic motion graphics that could belong to any video.

## Bias the storyboard toward the user flow

If Step 1 question 9 identified a real user flow, the **centerpiece scenes must show that flow** — not just landing-page recreations.

Good (working-app scenes):
- "Upload screen — cursor drops a video file. Filename appears. Progress bar fills 0→100% in 1.2s."
- "Three result thumbnails pop in: 0:15, 0:23, 0:31. Each shows a vertical clip frame with a real-looking caption."
- "Inbox row appears, gets a green 'resolved' badge, slides off the top of the list."

Avoid (marketing-only scenes when a flow exists):
- "16:9 → 9:16 transform diagram" — that's a *diagram of what the product does*, not the product doing it.
- "Three stat cards: 10x faster / 0 cuts / 3 clips" — that's the landing page's social-proof row, not the product.

Stat cards, headline blocks, and the landing-page hero still have a place — but at most one of them, used as a frame around the flow, not as a substitute. The centerpiece is the working app.

If the project has no app (landing-page-only static site), skip this section and recreate the landing-page strongest visual instead.

## Look for interaction and sequential reveal moments

Before writing the storyboard, ask: **does this product have things that can appear one by one, or actions that can be simulated?**

These are among the most effective moments in a brag video — they make the product feel alive and real, not like a slide deck. Look for:

- **Sequential reveals** — feature cards, stats, list items, match results, profile cards, menu options, or anything the product shows as a set. Design these to appear one by one so sound and motion reinforce each arrival. This is a storyboard decision, not an audio afterthought.
- **Simulated interaction** — if the product involves swiping, clicking, typing, selecting, or toggling, show it. A cursor clicking a button, a swipe gesture on a card, or text being typed into a field turns a static mockup into a demonstration. Sound matches the action automatically when the gesture is in the storyboard.

If a scene has either of these, commit to it explicitly in the scene description:
- Good: "3 horse profiles slide in one by one, each with a card sound"
- Good: "Simulate a right-swipe on Thunder's profile card"
- Good: "The hook line types out character by character with keyboard sounds"
- Avoid: leaving it vague and hoping Hyperframes adds rhythm on its own

Hyperframes can implement both patterns well — but only if the plan specifies what's appearing, in what order, and that interaction is being simulated. The plan is the contract.

## Audio planning

Choose the music direction in the plan. Leave exact SFX file selection and exact timestamps to Hyperframes during composition, because SFX should match the actual visual implementation.

Default posture: include audio. Pick a music bed and a few tasteful SFX unless the user passed `--no-music` / `--no-sfx`, the assets are missing, or silence is explicitly part of the concept.

For each scene, note the intended audio role and likely audio-coupled opportunities:

Format: `Audio-coupled idea: type the hook with subtle key ticks if Hyperframes uses a typing animation.`

For audio-reactive visuals, say what should respond and how restrained it should be. Example: `Audio-reactive treatment: subtle; use music RMS/bass to make the hero glow and product card presence breathe, not to add waveform bars.`

Do not require exact SFX filenames in `brag-plan.md` unless the user explicitly requested a specific sound or the mapping is unavoidable. Prefer moment types and intent.

Hyperframes has creative freedom to choose exact files, density, and timestamps that make the video feel smooth and professional.

Do not over-specify audio if the tone asks for restraint. For `yc-parody` or `deadpan`, use fewer and quieter cues, but prefer polished restraint over no audio.

## Music cue guidance

Beat/cue sync is available for any track now (see `audio.md` → "Beat and cue sources"): bundled tracks have precomputed presets; custom tracks get cues at composition time via `analyze_music_cues.py` (rich, needs Python) or `npx hyperframes beats` (simple, zero-dep). When the plan chooses music, add a compact `Music cue guidance` section to `brag-plan.md`:

- The track and, if a preset exists, its tempo.
- 1-3 strong-cue timestamps to target for major visual moments — from the preset if bundled, otherwise note "to be detected at composition time."
- Beat-grid windows for any sequential reveals in the storyboard.
- A restraint note when the tone is deadpan, yc-parody, or otherwise quiet.

See `audio.md` for the cue sources, JSON schema, and beat-sync tolerances.

If SFX are enabled, note likely sound opportunities but leave exact filenames to Hyperframes. Hyperframes should use the skill's `sfx-analysis.md` during composition.

## Handoff posture

- Good: "Recreate the swipe card with Thunder's profile and hay tags."
- Good: "Use the source site's amber/dark palette and serif headline feel."
- Good: "The stat reveal should feel like a deadpan startup metric slide."
- Avoid: "Use a GSAP timeline with this selector and this easing."
- Avoid: "Use this exact HTML structure."
- Avoid: "Load this specific runtime URL."

## Transition vocabulary

Match transitions to tone:

| Tone | Preferred transitions |
|---|---|
| `default` | Crossfade, clean wipe |
| `polished` | Soft crossfade, slide |
| `yc-parody` | Hard cut, minimal |
| `chaotic` | Hard cut, flash, zoom |
| `deadpan` | Slow crossfade, long hold |
| `cinematic` | Dramatic wipe, crossfade |
| `app-store` | Slide, smooth wipe |
